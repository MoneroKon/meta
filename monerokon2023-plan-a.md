## How

Unlike the previous event that relied heavily on volunteers, a professional team will be hired as part of the contract with La Fabrika, which includes an event project manager, sound, lighting, and video engineers, clean-up crew, and cloakroom attendants. La Fabrika will provide all required furniture (long and bistro tables, chairs), 5x10m stage, projector, screen, sound, and lighting equipment. We will separately hire an independent camera operator and several other freelancers to perform various administrative and design duties.

### Monero ATM

Not for sure yet, but we will try to have a Monero ATM, like we had in Lisbon. Once the location is confirmed, we will reach out to the supplier and arrange the logistics.

6. After which, the Community can vote whether or not to pay the invoice: **+1** to approve, **-1** to reject, **0** to abstain
7. After counting all votes, if the motion has a positive number, the invoice is moved to "Pending Payment"
8.  If the number is negative or 0, invoice is not paid and the proposer has the option to amend the invoice and seek approval the following week or withdraw the invoice by deleting entry in the Pending Community Approval board
