# Call for Papers, Tutorials, Student Posters

2023 3rd International Monero Konferenco on Security, Privacy, and Decentralization in Blockchain Technology (MONEROKON) strives to provide high-quality content that brings together scientists, researchers, and subject-matter experts to present state-of-the-art developments in their respective fields. In addition to papers that addresses the science, engineering, and mathematics of blockchain technology, we are also keen to receive multidisciplinary submissions that touch on the wider implications of this emerging technology in relation to art, sociology, psychology, politics, philosophy, ecology, and law. Along with this Call for Papers, we welcome lectures/tutorials and student poster presentations.

Submissions will be categorized into three tracks: (i) Security, (ii) Privacy, and (iii) Decentralization.
