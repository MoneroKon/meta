## Travel Cost Reimbursement Policy for MoneroKon Contributors

### 1. Policy

This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for reimbursing travel costs for MoneroKon Contributors. The purpose of this policy is to establish the primary guidelines and criteria for obtaining travel reimbursement for speakers or those providing similar contributions.

### 2. Eligibility

In order to be eligible to request travel cost reimbursement, the following conditions must be met:
- Participation in the MoneroKon as a speaker, panelist, workshop facilitator, or contributor of artwork.
- Notification of your intent to seek reimbursement must be communicated to the MoneroKon Organization through pretalx by May 31st.

### 3. Expenses

Travel expenses eligible for reimbursement include:

- **Transportation**: Economy-class flights, Second-class trains, Bus, Tram, Car-share, Scooters and Bikes to the event as well as transport to/from the airport/bus station/train station
- **Accommodation**: Standard economy hotel or hostel stay during the event for a maximum of N + 1 nights (N being the number of days of the event)

Each contributor will be subject to a reimbursement cap of 500 euros. This means that while you may submit expenses that exceed this cap, such as a intercontinental Flights ranging 1,000 euros, only up to 500 euros of those expenses will be reimbursed if all other applicable rules and requirements are met.

Reimbursement requests may be denied if the total budget allocated by MoneroKon for travel scholarships is exhausted. The total budget for travel reimbursements is set at 4,500 euros as of January 2025. This amount may be increased in the future, contingent upon the availability of additional funds.

Priority will be accorded to contributors who submit their reimbursement details earlier, following a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach.
