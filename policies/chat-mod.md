# MoneroKon Chat Moderation Policy

Portions of this document are adapted from Libera.Chatâ€™s Network Policies/Guidelines and Matrix Code of Conduct.

## Our goals and core values

The organizers of MoneroKon aim to have an open, friendly, and welcoming place in bridged channels on IRC, Matrix, and Telegram, where anyone can communicate freely. We also encourage collaboration and communication with users, including giving feedback tactfully and receive it gracefully.

## Unwanted behaviour

Unwanted behaviour could lead to a distribution in the daily operations and/or planning of MoneroKon, therefore, we do not tolerate: 

1. Unlawful content/activities under Swedish law;
2. Discrimination based on faith, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex or gender expression, disability, or age;
3. Threats of violence, physical or psychological;
4. Behaviour meant to deliberately harass, alarm, or distress a person;
5. Unsubstantiated claims, which may be viewed as libelous or defamatory;
6. Doxxing;
7. Collecting or sharing the private or confidential information of other people;
8. Sustained disruption of discussion;
9. Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease;
10.  Publication of non-harassing private communication.

## Basic netiquette (Good practice)

Avoid repeating content, e.g. asking your question every few minutes because you have not received an answer yet.

You should not mass highlight (mention by name) multiple people.

Avoid writing in ALL-UPPERCASE.

Do not demand - participate instead. If you have a problem or question, try to give out all information needed, and show some effort to get it answered or resolved. 

For complex topics that require in-depth discussions, opening a GitHub issue in MoneroKon meta repo would be a better forum to flesh out the details. https://github.com/MoneroKon/meta/issues

We recommend not pasting multiple lines into a channel. You should use an external pastebin service for larger sections of text.

## Text based communications, intentions and misunderstandings

MoneroKon chat channels are text-based method of communication, lacks many of the cues of in-person interaction. Sarcasm, humour, inside jokes and the like might not come across as intended and are easily misunderstood. People might also have a different cultural background and perceive things differently than you do. We therefore recommend that you assume good faith and, in the event of a potential misunderstanding, ask for clarification rather than accuse.

## Controversial topics

Some topics are more prone to heated debates than others. These topics include, among others, politics, religion/faith and ideologies. We recommend keeping off-topic discussions to a minimum.

## Supporting Claims

The starting point is a presumption of innocence/good faith. The burden of proof is on the person who brings a claim. To rebut the presumption, evidence must help show that there is a greater than 50% chance that the asserted claim is true. Circumstantial evidence and the reporting of 3rd party statements (hearsay) have a lower degree of weight than direct, real evidence.

## Warning and Bans

- Yellow Card - When a user engages in unwanted behaviour, a Moderator will give the user a first warning to stop engaging in such activity.
- Orange Card - If user continues to violate Chat Moderation Policy, Moderator will give the user a second warning.
- Red Card - If user continues the unwanted behaviour, Moderator will issue a temporary ban for 7 days. 

## 3 Strikes and You're Out

If a user has had two temporary bans, the third ban results in a permanent ban.

Doxxing someone is an immediate permanent ban.
