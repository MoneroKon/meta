### Neuchâtel

If the 554.47 XMR target is not met within 90 days of this CCS being merged, but the raised amount is more than 383.86 XMR, the funds would be committed for the Neuchâtel venue as an alternative to Prague.

If we end up going with the lower cost venue at the [University of Neuchâtel](https://www.unine.ch/batiments/home/prestations/location-de-laula-des-jeunes-riv.html) in Switzerland, the contract with the university does not include staff support, so we would need find volunteers there. Luckily, the people at [Nym](https://nymtech.net) and [Darkfi](https://dark.fi) have offered to collaborate with us in Neuchâtel, which should help solve the staffing shortage if we go that route.

#### Neuchâtel

The cost for Neuchâtel is estimated to be about 102,000€ and we would be seeking 383.86 XMR in funding, which accounts for 37-42% of costs assuming all targets are met. We also included a 15% contingency fund for emergencies or unexpected expenses. The budget can be found [here]( https://cryptpad.disroot.org/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/8VOY0kS0fOgYS6IbA2WQ0cvNnEiWfbfZ7dYEPKyBUbA/embed/).
